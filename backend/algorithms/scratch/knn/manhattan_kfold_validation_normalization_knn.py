K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification with Manhattan Distance

This module implements KNN classification from scratch using:
- Manhattan distance metric (L1 norm)
- Data normalization for better performance
- K-fold cross-validation for model evaluation
- Majority voting for classification

Mathematical Foundation:
- Manhattan Distance: d(x,y) = Σ|xᵢ - yᵢ|
- Classification: majority vote among k nearest neighbors
