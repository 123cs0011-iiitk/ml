# Machine Learning Algorithms

This module contains ML algorithms for stock price prediction.

## Structure

- **`real/`** - Production-ready algorithms (KNN, LSTM, Random Forest, ARIMA, SVM, Neural Networks)
- **`scratch/`** - Experimental algorithms and research prototypes

## Status

Currently in development. Algorithms will be implemented here as they reach production readiness.
