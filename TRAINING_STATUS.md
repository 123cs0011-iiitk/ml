## Performance Ranking

All models are awaiting training. Performance ranking will be available after training is complete.

## Summary

- **Successfully trained models:** 0/9 (0%)
- **Models ready for training:** 9/9 (100%)
- **All model implementations verified and ready**
- **Fresh start - no previous training data**

## Next Steps

Train models in recommended order:

1. **Linear Regression** (5-10 min) - Good baseline model
2. **Decision Tree** (5-10 min) - Fast and interpretable
3. **Random Forest** (10-15 min) - Expected best performer
4. **KNN** (15-25 min) - Instance-based learning
5. **SVM** (20-30 min) - Support vector regression
6. **ANN** (30-45 min) - Neural network
7. **Autoencoder** (40-60 min) - Feature extraction
8. **CNN** (45-75 min) - Convolutional network
9. **ARIMA** (90-180 min) - Time series (slowest)
